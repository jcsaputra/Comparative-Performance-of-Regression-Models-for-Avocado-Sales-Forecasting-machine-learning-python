# Comparative Performance of Regression Models for Avocado Sales Forecasting

This project evaluates the effectiveness of three regression models—Random Forest, Multiple Linear Regression, and Polynomial Regression—in forecasting avocado sales volumes across the United States. Using historical data, the models predict sales volumes based on key factors such as average price, product lookup (PLU) codes, avocado type, and year. The goal is to identify the most accurate model for reliable avocado sales forecasting.

## Key Features
- **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, outlier detection, normalization, and encoding for a clean dataset.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizations to explore data patterns, distributions, and correlations among variables.
- **Regression Modeling:** Implementations of Random Forest, Multiple Linear, and Polynomial regression models.
- **Performance Evaluation:** Comparison using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared (R²).

## Installation
Clone the repository and install dependencies from `requirements.txt`.

## Usage
1. Load and preprocess the avocado dataset.
2. Perform EDA to understand data patterns.
3. Run the regression models and evaluate their performance.
4. Generate visualizations to interpret model predictions.

## Results
Our analysis found that the Random Forest Regressor achieved the highest accuracy with an R² score of 0.96, suggesting it as the optimal model for avocado sales forecasting.
